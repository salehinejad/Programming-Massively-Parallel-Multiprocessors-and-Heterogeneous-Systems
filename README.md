The aim of the course is to provide hands-on experience in developing applications software for graphics processors with massively parallel computing resources. The target audiences of the course are those who want to develop exciting applications for these processors, as well as those who want to develop programming tools and future implementations for these processors. The initial part of the course focuses on popular programming interfaces for these processors. The course continues with a closer view of the internal organization of graphics processors and how it impacts performance. Finally, implementations of applications and algorithms on these processors will be discussed.
